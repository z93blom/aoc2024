Could this <em>finally</em> be your chance to visit the [onsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onsen) next door? Only one way to find out.

After a brief conversation with the reception staff at the onsen front desk, you discover that you don't have the right kind of money to pay the admission fee. However, before you can leave, the staff get your attention.
