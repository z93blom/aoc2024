## --- Day 16: Reindeer Maze ---
It's time again for the [Reindeer Olympics](/2015/day/14)! This year, the big event is the <em>Reindeer Maze</em>, where the Reindeer compete for the <em>lowest score</em>.

You and The Historians arrive to search for the Chief right as the event is about to start. It wouldn't hurt to watch a little, right?

The Reindeer start on the Start Tile (marked <code>S</code>) facing <em>East</em> and need to reach the End Tile (marked <code>E</code>). They can move forward one tile at a time (increasing their score by <code>1</code> point), but never into a wall (<code>#</code>). They can also rotate clockwise or counterclockwise 90 degrees at a time (increasing their score by <code>1000</code> points).
