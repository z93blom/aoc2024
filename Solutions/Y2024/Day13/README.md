## --- Day 13: Claw Contraption ---
Next up: the [lobby](/2020/day/24) of a resort on a tropical island. The Historians take a moment to admire the hexagonal floor tiles before spreading out.

Fortunately, it looks like the resort has a new [arcade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusement_arcade)! Maybe you can win some prizes from the [claw machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claw_machine)?

The claw machines here are a little unusual. Instead of a joystick or directional buttons to control the claw, these machines have two buttons labeled <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>. Worse, you can't just put in a token and play; it costs <em>3 tokens</em> to push the <code>A</code> button and <em>1 token</em> to push the <code>B</code> button.
