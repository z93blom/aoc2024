## --- Day 18: RAM Run ---
You and The Historians look a lot more pixelated than you remember. You're [inside a computer](/2017/day/2) at the North Pole!

Just as you're about to check out your surroundings, a program runs up to you. "This region of memory isn't safe! The User misunderstood what a [pushdown automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushdown_automaton) is and their algorithm is pushing whole <em>bytes</em> down on top of us! Run!"

The algorithm is fast - it's going to cause a byte to fall into your memory space once every [nanosecond](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eyFDBPk4Yw)! Fortunately, you're <em>faster</em>, and by quickly scanning the algorithm, you create a <em>list of which bytes will fall</em> (your puzzle input) in the order they'll land in your memory space.
